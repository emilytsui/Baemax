		<p> <font face="verdana" size="5"> What we tried to solve: Our goal was to create an inflatable desktop Baymax to perform basic interactions. We wanted to build a soft robot that would be able imitate the hugging motion with shoulder, arm, and wrist movements, as well as shake hands. The purpose of this Baymax is to be placed on top of a desk and provide entertainment and comfort to its users by interacting with them.<br/><br/>
		Approaches: Our original plan was to create a life size huggable Baymax by building a robotic arm with Dynamixel servos; however, the servos were incompatible with Arduino, so we decided to work with the smaller Arduino-compatible servos. Our new plan was to create a smaller-scale desktop Baymax. After we got the smaller servos working, we created a cardboard arm to utilize these and test our model. Using the dimensions in the diagram below, we cut out the cardboard pieces and attached them to create an arm with two degrees of freedom to perform the hugging motion. After successfully accomplishing this, we duplicated our efforts with laser cut pieces and put placed the arm inside a 15" plushy Baymax suit. We added a third degree of rotation at the shoulders, and enabled Baymax to shake hands as well.</font> <br> <br>
