        <h2 style="font-zie:30px"> A Huggable and Hand-Shaking Desktop Baymax! </h2>
        <p> <font face="verdana" size="4"> Our Desktop Baymax has two laser-cut acryllic arms that are attached to servos. </p>
        <p> <font face="verdana" size="4"> The servos are powered by an Arduino Uno, located in the back of Baymax. </p>
        <p> <font face="verdana" size="4"> Everything is pieced together with a plush doll suit. </p>

		<h2 style="font-size:30px"> What we learned </h2>
		<p><font face="verdana" size="5">Our main goal is to create a huggable desktop baymax that could be easily created by following an user guide. <br> <br>
		Due to the members lack of experience in related areas, we had to start from scratch and scale down on our first attempt. However, through trial and error, we were able to figure out problems that we faced and create solutions. To demonstrate the movements of a hug and a handshake, we had to break the moves down to the behavior of each axis of rotation in order to understand the angular movement and speed of the different servos. 
		<br> <br>
		Furthermore, the weight and power of the servos also affect how we can manipulate the movements without making the structure vulnerable and unstable. We learned to create a balance between the size and position of each segments of the arm and the servos to mimic the correct movement while maintaining stability in the body.
		<br><br>
		Lastly, for aesthetic reasons, we had to conceal the board and wires inside the doll to prevent users from accidentally disconnecting the structure. Most importantly, we learned to ensure that the battery provides enough power for the servos in order to lose the use of a laptop.</font></p>
